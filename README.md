Basics of logistic regression/classification.
Best for understanding the basic difference b/w linear and logistic regression.
Takes 4 variables/attributes as input and predicts whether its a Iris Setosa(0) or Virginica(1).
The variables are:

sepal_length: Sepal length, in centimeters, used as input.
sepal_width: Sepal width, in centimeters, used as input.
petal_length: Petal length, in centimeters, used as input.
petal_width: Petal width, in centimeters, used as input.

output comparision with:
class: Iris Setosa(0) or Virginica(1), used as the target.

Classification algorithm.
